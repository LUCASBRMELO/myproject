Script explanation and data modification
Firstly the appropiate working directory is set. The script is written in a way such that the working directories assignments must be changed if running in another computer. 
Everything else need not to be changed. The directories must contain the project databasis.

The commands are divided into 5 sets, each set refers to its respectively step in the project guide.

The first set of commands assign the csv.data to dataframes X_test and X_train after reading and merging them (individuals id and activities data by train or test).
The following commands merge both dataframes.

The second set of comands, selects the features that estimates means and standard deviations and their respectively columns in the dataframe called "data".

The third and fourth commands are jointly written in the script, they refer to Step 3 and 4. Basically, they give appropriate labels to variables and name the last column "id"
of the dataframe.

Finally, set 5 construct the tidy data in only one command and then save it as a csv. file.

The following list contains the variables description in the tidy.csv file.

Where variables "X" and "id" refer to observation rows and individual id, respectively. The other variables are averages of activity mean when its name contains "means" and averages
of standard deviations when the its name contains "std". The first characters contains the activity name.
